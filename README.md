# ERS-Project1

An Expense Reimbursement System that manages the process of reimbursing employees for expenses that occurred during company time.
All registered employees can login in, submit ticket requests and view their past tickets.
All registered financial managers can log in, view all submitted tickets and either approve or deny any pending tickets.

This application follows a DAO Front Controller design pattern using JBDC and PostgreSQL for persistent data storage and deployed onto a Tomcat Server.
